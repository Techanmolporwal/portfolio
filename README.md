#PORTFOLIO
First and most importantly, a web developer portfolio is the thing that contains your web developer projects.
Think of it as a repository for your best work.
Secondly, a web developer portfolio illustrates who you are as a developer. For example, it answers questions like:
Whatâ€™s your developer speciality?
Which technologies have you studied?
What do you excel at?
What types of problems do you solve?
At the end of the day, your web developer portfolio is not only a marketing tool, but proof that you have the necessary tech skills to make you employable.
